## Description

In this assignment, we are introduced to the database system MySQL and use it to create tables that can store and update data. In this particular project, we used the database system to view and manage employees.

## Installation

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is required to run this application. Between v16 and v18 is recommended.

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is also required for this application to function.

The following packages were installed via terminal:

- `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` allows interaction with the database
- `npm i mysql2` allows connection to the MySQL database
- `npm i figlet` renders the visual title of the app
- `npm i table` produces a visualized table for data

## Usage

Once the user types `node index`, they are prompted with the application
